**If you find value in this software please consider supporting it's continued development through [sponsorship](https://github.com/sponsors/OpenGIS). Any amount is appreciated.**

By default only your most recent location is displayed. To display more data, Start and end dates can be provided through the Shortcode like this:

```
[inreach-mapshare mapshare_identifier="your_identifier" mapshare_date_start="2022-06-15T00:00" mapshare_date_end="2022-07-31T23:59"]
```

You can display a GeoJSON Route accessible via a URL like this:

```
[inreach-mapshare mapshare_route_url="https://www.example.com/my-route.geojson" mapshare_identifier="your_identifier" mapshare_date_start="2022-06-15T00:00"]
```

The MapShare feature must be enabled in the <a href="https://explore.garmin.com/Social">Social</a> tab of your Garmin Explore account.

Features:

- Embed an interactive Map and timeline containing track points and messages shared with your MapShare page.
- Display your planned route using the Shortcode (URL accessible GeoJSON supported).
- Each point displayed contains the following information:
  - Time UTC
  - Time (local)
  - Event (e.g. a message, or track point)
  - Text (for messages)
  - Latitude
  - Longitude
  - Elevation
  - Velocity
  - Valid GPS Fix
- The plugin updates your MapShare every 15 minutes and is cached to improve performance (adjustable in Settings).
- Use the in-built demo to preview how your MapShare will display (`[inreach-mapshare mapshare_identifier="demo"]`).
- Customise in WP Admin > Settings > inReach MapShare.
- Appearance settings:
  - Basemap - <a href="https://www.openstreetmap.org/fixthemap">OpenStreetMap</a> by default, lots of <a href="https://leaflet-extras.github.io/leaflet-providers/preview/">other providers</a> supported.
  - Colour - pick a colour to suit your theme.
  - Icons - use SVG images as icons.
- Content is responsive, and adapts to suit devices both small and large.
- Customise content with your own CSS rules.
- Translation ready :)

If you experience any issues with the plugin, ensure that your MapShare page (i.e. share.garmin.com/[your_identifier]) is displaying data. This is important - this plugin can only display data available to your MapShare.

> [!CAUTION]
> Even if you have a MapShare password set, this plugin simply uses it to request your data; it does not protect it from being viewed. You are responsible for <a href="https://wordpress.org/support/article/using-password-protection/">protecting access</a> if needed.

Please report issues or make suggestions by creating a <a href="https://github.com/opengis/inreach-mapshare/issues">GitHub issue</a>.
